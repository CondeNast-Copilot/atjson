## 💁‍♀️ What is PRISM

PRISM is an acronym for Publishing Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata. The format is used in publishing to provide information about published works, primarily those that are printed in magazines, books, or other media.

Brands at Condé Nast such as the New Yorker, WIRED, and Vogue have versions of their print magazines annotated in PRISM XML that provides necessary metadata for our teams to extract data from.
