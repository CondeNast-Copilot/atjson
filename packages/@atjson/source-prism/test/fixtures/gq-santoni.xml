<p>In the fantastical universe of Santoni, a shoe is not just a shoe&#8212;it is an <i>object of desire,</i> according to the label&#39;s CEO, Giuseppe Santoni. The tradition of handmade shoes and the skillful artisans in the brand&#39;s workshop are guided not by corporate responsibility or nine-to-five obligation but by a watchful genie. An energy that maintains the quality of the label&#39;s shoes, so says Santoni. The brand is headquartered in the Italian region of Marche&#8212;what appears to be a paradise hundreds of miles from the country&#39;s fashion capital. And of course Santoni tells his family&#39;s tale in an Italian accent that&#39;s as thick and comforting as a good red sauce. &#8220;Growing up surrounded by beauty, you get affected by this influence,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>His English is near perfect. When Santoni was barely 20, his father sent him to England specifically to learn the language so that he could eventually sell the shoes to English-speaking clientele. He&#39;s been part of the family-owned business, originally founded by his parents in 1975, since he was a child. No choice, really: The shoe workshop and the Santoni household were attached. That Santoni would one day take up the mantle of CEO was never in question. &#8220;Unlike the other kids in the world,&#8221; Santoni says, &#8220;I never dreamed to become a policeman or a fireman; I just wanted to do my father&#39;s job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe it is this generational devotion to crafting shoes that sets Santoni apart from other footwear labels. There are plenty of brands that make fine dress shoes. But Santoni, the brand and the man, is not satisfied with shoes so steeped in tradition and precious about design that they remain unchanged for decades. &#8220;I don&#39;t like to make shoes that always look the same,&#8221; he says. Sure, the label sells the classics, but a &#8220;black&#8221; Santoni cap-toe oxford might burn just beneath the surface with a deep blue&#8212;an effect achieved by painting on a dozen layers of color. This sort of shoe epitomizes Santoni&#39;s design philosophy. Like any good character in a Pixar movie, the shoes are timeless objects imbued with a bit of magic.</p>
<p>In 2018, you can&#39;t just design shoes. For years, people have been led to believe that it&#39;s completely acceptable to fill up closets and storage units by amassing the latest shoes and sneakers. This is the quandary for Santoni, which is in the business of selling you dress shoes with four-figure price tags that it wants you to keep for decades. &#8220;We make things that are absolutely useless for the survival of a person,&#8221; says Santoni. &#8220;Nowadays, everyone has more shoes than you need to live three lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shoe overload is why Santoni paints its pairs of oxfords again, then again, then again, then again, then maybe a couple more times after that. A simple pair of boots is equipped with buckles, straps, and gold zippers. Other brands are interested in classics that will last a lifetime; Santoni aims a little north of that, adding subtle new twists that you&#39;ve never seen before&#8212;but that will endure just as long. The brand wants to make understated shoes &#8220;but never a boring product or something [that makes] you say, &#8216;I already have this,&#8217; &#8221; Santoni explains.</p>
<p>To do this, the company continues to employ artisans who have spent a lifetime with the family&#8212;Santoni&#39;s folks still get their hands on every shoe before it leaves the factory&#8212;but it also brings in young designers to sit on the other end of the seesaw, warding off boring products. Santoni says arguments between young and old employees occur every day: &#8220;But it&#39;s a clash where young people want to do things very difficult, and old people don&#39;t want to change. They do good together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result of this back-and-forth is a shoe as well constructed as anything out there but that doesn&#39;t turn its nose up at fashion. For Santoni, there are two types of people in the world. The first is &#8220;lawyers, very classic people, they love English shoes,&#8221; he explains. But then there are the people who ask for more from their footwear. Italy, he argues, is at the forefront of creativity, where customers might be entranced by tales of genies or smoldering blue lace-up dress shoes. Santoni doesn&#39;t just do beautiful footwear, after all. Fitting, because as Santoni sees it, those buying the brand aren&#39;t really interested in shoes, either. &#8220;The Santoni customer,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is a beauty lover.&#8221;</p>
