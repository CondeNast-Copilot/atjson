Trans-related books continue to gain critical attention this year as Lambda Literary announced the nominees for their [Lambda Literary Awards](https://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/) today, known informally as the Lammys. Akwaeke Emezi’s *Freshwater* and Jordy Rosenberg’s *Confessions of the Fox* highlight a transgender fiction category that in the past has tended to feature books that have gotten less mainstream attention than their gay and lesbian counterparts.



Not so this year, as Emezi and Rosenberg have both been shortlisted for the [Center for Fiction’s First Novel Prize](http://centerforfiction.org/awards/the-first-novel-prize/2018-first-novel-prize/), and Emezi was named one of the [National Book Foundation’s “5 under 35”](https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/5-under-35-2018/) for 2018\. In Transgender Memoir/Biography, [them. columnist Thomas Page McBee](https://www.them.us/contributor/thomas-page-mcbee) was nominated for his boxing memoir *Amateur,* a book that was shortlisted for the [2018 Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction](https://thebailliegiffordprize.co.uk/2018-shortlist).



Even the gay fiction category includes Joseph Cassara’s *The House of Impossible Beauties*, a novel based on the New York ball scene that features a number of prominent transgender characters. That category also features Uzodinma Iweala’s *Speak No Evil*, a novel about a high school student’s painful efforts to come out in a conservative Nigerian family, as well as the acclaimed French author Édouard Louis’ *History of Violence*, a novel about the aftermath of sexual assault.



When asked about the trend towards trans-related books sparking mainstream interest, Lambda Literary Executive Director Sue Landers wrote over email: "Given the sheer number of terrific LGBTQ books, it's not at all uncommon for Lammy finalists to garner mainstream attention and accolades. But yes, we have seen over the past few years, as trans visibility has increased and the general public's understanding of trans lives has deepened, mainstream media has made some strides towards becoming more trans inclusive. This is due in no small part to all the work small, unheralded, and independent trans centered presses have done for a long time, work that changed how we can and should view the queer literary canon. Of course, much work remains to be done to bring even more of these books into the world and to shine a light on them."



In nonfiction, the Gay Memoir/Biography category features a number of acclaimed titles, including Alexander Chee, whose essay collection *[How to Write an Autobiographical Novel](https://www.them.us/story/sad-queer-books-alexander-chee)* has been on numerous Best Book lists this year. That category also features two memoirs by gay black men, Black Lives Matter activist [DeRay Mckesson’s *On the Other Side of Freedom*](https://www.them.us/story/deray-mckesson-on-the-other-side-of-freedom), and critic and activist [Darnell Moore’s *No Ashes in the Fire*](https://www.them.us/story/what-adults-never-told-me-as-a-queer-black-child)*.*



This year's nominations in the lesbian and bisexual categories feature books almost exclusively from small and academic presses. Notable works include Sarah Schulman's *Maggie Terry* in lesbian fiction, as well as *Berenice Abbot: A Life in Photography*, Julia Van Haaften's biography of the acclaimed photographer. The LGBTQ Young Adult category features a number of acclaimed and popular books, most notably Kheryn Callender's gay teen romance, *This Is Kind of an Epic Love Story*, as well as the Claire Legrand thriller *Sawkill Girls*.



Other familiar names on this year’s nomination list include Eileen Myles in the lesbian poetry category for *Evolution*, Roxane Gay in the LGBTQ anthology category for *Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture*, and the gay historian Martin Duberman, nominated in both gay fiction for *Luminous Traitor*, and in LGBTQ Nonfiction for *Has the Gay Movement Failed?*



Lambda Literary is the leading LGBTQ literary organization in the United States, and has been giving out its Lambda Literary Awards since 1989\. [This year’s ceremony](https://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/buy-tickets/) will be held on June 3 at NYU’s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts.
