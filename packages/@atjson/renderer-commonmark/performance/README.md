# ‚è± Performance

The metrics below are taken from the CommonMark specification tests. These are _not_ realistic examples of what you'd find out in the world, but it is a fairly large dataset that runs the code through its paces.

This benchmark was taken on macOS High Sierra on x64 with 8 cores of Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4870HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz.
