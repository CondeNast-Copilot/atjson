# ‚è± Performance

The metrics below are taken from the CommonMark specification tests. These are _not_ realistic examples of what you'd find out in the world, but it is a fairly large dataset that runs the code through its paces.

This benchmark was taken on Linux 4.15 on x64 with 2 cores of Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz.
