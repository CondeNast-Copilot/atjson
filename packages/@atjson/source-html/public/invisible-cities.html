  <em>Kublai Khan</em> does not necessarily believe everything Marco Polo says
  when he describes the cities visited on his expeditions, but the emperor of
  the Tartars does continue listening to the young Venetian with greater
  attention and curiosity than he shows any other messenger or explorer of his.
  In the lives of emperors there is a moment which follows pride in the
  boundless extension of the territories we have conquered, and the melancholy
  and relief of knowing we shall soon give up any thought of knowing and
  understanding them. There is a sense of emptiness that comes over us at
  evening, with the odor of the elephants after the rain and the sandalwood
  ashes growing cold in the braziers, a dizziness that makes rivers and
  mountains tremble on the fallow curves of the planispheres where they are
  portrayed, and rolls up, one after the other, the despatches announcing to us
  the collapse of the last enemy troops, from defeat to defeat, and flakes the
  wax of the seals of obscure kings who beseech our armies' protection, offering
  in exchange annual tributes of precious metals, tanned hides, and tortoise
  shell. It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had
  seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that
  corruption's gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the
  triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.
  Only in Marco Polo's accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the
  walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it
  could escape the termites' gnawing.

<h2>CITIES & MEMORY</h2>
<p>
  Leaving there and proceeding for three days toward the east, you reach
  Diomira, a city with sixty silver domes, bronze statues of all the gods,
  streets paved with lead, a crystal theater, a golden cock that crows each
  morning on a tower. All these beauties will already be familiar to the
  visitor, who has seen them also in other cities. But the special quality of
  this city for the man who arrives there on a September evening, when the days
  are growing shorter and the multicolored lamps are lighted all at once at the
  doors of the food stalls and from a terrace a woman's voice cries ooh!, is
  that he feels envy toward those who now believe they have once before lived an
  evening identical to this and who think they were happy, that time.
