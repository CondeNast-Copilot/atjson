title: ⚛️ atjson + React
---

atjson has a built-in libarary for rendering documents into React.
We've designed the React renderer to have a one to one correlation
between annotations and React components.

## Getting Started

Install the React renderer using `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save @atjson/renderer-react
```
