## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on conventions for indicating formatting in email and usenet posts. It was developed by John Gruber (with help from Aaron Swartz) and released in 2004 in the form of a [syntax description](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and a Perl script (Markdown.pl) for converting Markdown to HTML.
