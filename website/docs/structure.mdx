title: ðŸ§± Structure

An atjson document has the content, and the annotations. Annotations are
data about the content, and have `start` and `end` positions that refer
to positional offsets in the document.

Positions represent the space *in between* characters in the document. That
means an annotation that starts at `0` starts before any character in the document.

import { CharacterOffsetViewer } from '../src/components/CharacterOffsetViewer.tsx';

<CharacterOffsetViewer>Hello</CharacterOffsetViewer>

The content of the document above is `Hello`, and there are no annotations.
